# Airline disasters analysis
Airline disasters analysis from 1919 to 2023

The project consists of analysing a dataset containing almost 25,000 airline accidents recorded from 1919 to 2023. 
The information available includes the date of the accident, the type of aircraft, the operator, the number of victims, the location and country of the accident, and the accident category (according to ASN). 
Through the use of Python libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib, the aim is to extract useful insights through graphs and visualisations. 
The analysis can focus on trends over time, the operators with the most incidents, the countries most affected, and the severity of incidents.
